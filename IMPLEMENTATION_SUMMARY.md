# TexasSolver TUI - Implementation & Optimization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancements, optimizations, and structural changes made to the `TexasSolver TUI` project to improve performance, user experience, and portability.

## 1. Performance Optimizations
To achieve near-instantaneous solver results while maintaining strategic relevance, the following optimizations were implemented in `solver.rs`:

*   **Reduced Iterations:** The maximum solver iterations were reduced to **10** (from 15+), and the accuracy target was relaxed to **5.0**. This drastically cuts down calculation time for the Flop and Turn.
*   **Game Tree Pruning:**
    *   **OOP Donk Bets Removed:** The Out-of-Position (OOP) player is forced to check to the aggressor on the Flop and Turn, removing complex and often unnecessary "donk bet" branches from the game tree.
    *   **Range Filtering:** The `activate_hand_in_range` function was optimized to filter out hands with `0.0` probability from the input range string, reducing the payload sent to the C++ solver.
*   **River Strategy:** River bet sizes were initially removed for speed but have been **restored** to ensure a complete and "perfect" strategy calculation (avoiding an artificial check-down scenario).

## 2. Feature Enhancements

### Hand Strength Evaluator
A custom poker hand evaluator was implemented in `src/evaluator.rs`.
*   **Functionality:** Parses the Hero's hand and the board cards to determine the absolute hand strength (e.g., "Straight", "Top Pair", "Flush Draw").
*   **Scoring:** Assigns a numerical **Strength Score (0-100)** to the hand for educational purposes.
*   **Integration:** The TUI now displays this description and score alongside the Hero's hand (e.g., `Hero Hand: Ah Kd (Straight (Strength: 74/100))`).

### Strategy Display
*   **Response to Bet:** The TUI now explicitly extracts and displays the OOP player's strategy (Call/Fold/Raise frequencies) if the IP player bets, providing a more complete strategic picture.
*   **Visuals:** The interface uses a cleaner, borderless panel design for better readability.

## 3. Runtime Portability
A standalone runtime environment was created to allow the application to run without the full source code or Cargo environment.

### `Texas_soverTui_Runtime` Folder
This folder contains everything needed to run the solver:
*   **`texas_solver_tui`**: The compiled release executable.
*   **`TexasSolver-v0.2.0-MacOs/`**: The C++ console solver binary.
*   **`resources/`**: Configuration files and output directories.
*   **`strategy.json`**: The output file generated by the solver.

### Key Fixes for Portability
*   **Relative Paths:** Code was updated to look for `resources/` and `strategy.json` in the current working directory (`./`) rather than the parent directory (`../`).
*   **CWD Independence:** Removed the dependency on `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`, allowing the executable to run correctly from any location (specifically the Runtime folder) without reverting to the build directory.
*   **Execution Stability:** Switched from `.spawn()` to `.output()` in Rust's `Command` execution to prevent stdout buffer deadlocks that were causing the application to hang.

## 4. How to Run
To use the optimized, portable solver:

1.  Navigate to the runtime folder:
    ```bash
    cd Texas_soverTui_Runtime
    ```
2.  Run the executable with your hand, board, and (optionally) turn/river cards:
    ```bash
    ./texas_solver_tui <HeroHand> <Flop> [Turn] [River]
    ```
    **Example:**
    ```bash
    ./texas_solver_tui AhKd QsJh2h Ac Th
    ```

## 5. File Structure Changes
*   **`src/evaluator.rs`**: New file containing hand evaluation logic.
*   **`src/solver.rs`**: Heavily modified for optimization, path fixing, and execution stability.
*   **`src/ui/flow.rs`**: Updated for new display features and path handling.
*   **`src/json_out/parse.rs`**: Updated to extract additional strategy data.
